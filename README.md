# README

## Overview

This repository is a simple attempt to get K3s running in a `bootc` container. While most steps are functional, there is an unresolved issue with the final step. For reference, [cdrage's containerfile repository](https://github.com/cdrage/containerfile) provides great examples, including a `bootc` container file for K3s.

## Instructions

To build the container, run:

```bash
podman-compose build
```

Feel free to explore and adapt!
